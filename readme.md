Football stats site built using Laravel, Vue.js and Bootstrap.
Includes API which is reading data from football-data.org, so thank you to Daniel Freitag for the data.

Site is very much under construction, but works by using a cron job to bring data into a MySQL database using curl requests from football-data.org. The site then pulls data from an internal API (built using laravel) so as many requests can be made as needed. 

JUST A TEST
